Roadwarrior <b>carol</b> proposes to gateway <b>moon</b> the cipher suite
<b>CHACHA20_POLY1305</b> both for IKE and ESP by defining
<b>ike=chacha20poly1305-prfsha256-x25519</b> and
<b>esp=chacha20poly1305-x25519</b> in ipsec.conf, respectively.
A ping from <b>carol</b> to <b>alice</b> successfully checks the established tunnel.
